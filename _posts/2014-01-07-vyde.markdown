We are very excited to announce the launch of VYDE! We&#x2019;ve been working on this game concept for the past year - refining and redoing levels until we were satisfied. Lesson learned: game design a difficult task of balancing multiple aspects of play.

What is VYDE? Good question. VYDE is a top down touch based stealth game. You&#x2019;ve infiltrated the headquarters of a rogue organization. With vital information in your satchel (yep, you&#x2019;re that cool), your objective is to escape the enemy stronghold full of baddies - a childhood dream come true!

Use your ability to blend in with the environment to hide in plain sight. Evade patrolling guards room after room on each floor of the skyscraper without being seen and make your way to the ground floor before the sun comes out.
