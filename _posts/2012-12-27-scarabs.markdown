We are happy to finally write about a game we have been developing: Scarabs. Scarabs is a game suited for all occasions. An Egyptian twist on the classic shell game, Scarabs rewards you for following a scarab hidden under jars as they are shuffled.

The game advances in difficulty the more you play. Furthermore we have introduced several challenge game modes to test your skills!
